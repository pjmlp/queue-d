 This is the D implementation of a simple challenge about Queues implementation
with manual memory management, taken from a job advertisement for a game development studio.

 The original coding was done in C++, available at https://github.com/pjmlp/queue.

 To compile the program just call invoke make on the top level directory. Aftwerwards
you can call the queue executable.
